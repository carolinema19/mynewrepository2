You Never Walk Alone

Around the campfire, as the sun returned home,
Seven remained, once upon a time.
The shouts of adventure never diminished, and 
As the days and nights glowed,
One brother was accompanied by six— 
A family never to be separated.
Although darkness crept in, shadows grew cold, we
Ran in this maze of uncertainty. 
The exhilaration, once flowing through our bloodstream,
Carries on, and I hold the burden of all.
Sitting among my friends, I know
Their next words, as they are my own.
Laughter spreads across me, and this moment
Will last an eternity. Despite
Being torn apart by reality, blood surfacing on my shirt, 
I held their frigid hands and my conscience turned away. 
In an epic of tragedies, I was my very own muse, 
Lighting their way into a new fantasy;
Everything is okay. 
Petals strewn across the uneven floor,
Burst into flames as greed knocked on the door. 
On the fields, I gifted them all: painless immortality
In the cradle of my arms.
The swift sting of a knife,
The muted strangling of water,
The shards of broken glass,
And the burnt crisps of gasoline
Served as a reminder of their youth,
And my forever. 
Our bond will never break, as 
The rest of their story
Is within the control of my palm.
For all that a stranger would see  
Is one little boy dreaming, 
Holding onto camaraderies of old,  
That once dreamt alongside him too.
